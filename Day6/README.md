**Difference between let and var :**

- let is block scope and var is function scope.
- The area between two curly brackets is called scope or block or context
        
       {
	       \\Scope
       }
       
**Superhero project :**

- First, we created an object named superheroes with an array of objects in it. 
- In this project, we are going to display superheroes object on a tabular form, insert into the table, delete from the table.
- To display first, we created rows variable and assigned superheroes to object properties in order to display in the webpage.
- To add the values to the table, first, create an empty superhero object. Fetch the values from the input field and then add it to the table.
- To delete values from the table we have used the splice() method. splice has two parameters that is index and no. of values to be deleted.

**Example: splice ( index , 1 );**
